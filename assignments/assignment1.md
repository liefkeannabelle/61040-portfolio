# Assignment 1

**Potential problem areas:**

1. Time Management: organizing tasks to make tackling the day easier.

2. New music finder: make finding new music, especially beyond what you currently listen to, easier and more social.

3. Casual sports watching: emphasize the fun, social, casual side of being a sports fan or viewer and remove the focus from knowing everything or winning a bet or fantasy game.

4. Reality TV viewing: foster community among viewers of different shows, even who are not watching on the day of release.

5. Weightlifting: simplify tracking and progressing lifts with more neutral language than most current platforms feature.

**Let's dive a bit deeper:**

*Domain #1:* Time Management

I've selected this as one of my domains of interest because I feel as though it is the most relevant to me currently as a college student. While there are a lot of existing systems available, it seems like there are certain gaps in what is currently out there.

Potential Problems:

    1. Interdependent tasks during to-do list creation. -> I often run into the situation where I have a bunch of tasks to tackle, but some of them need to happen in certain orders. This app would allow you to enter individual tasks and their dependencies (i.e. I need to "buy shampoo" before I can "wash my hair") and present viable ordered to-do lists of the tasks at hand.

    2. Time block helper. -> Though many people benefit from time blocking to plan their day or week in advance, it can be difficult when you don't know how long certain tasks will take. This app would allow you to record the length of time different activities (i.e. 8.01 PSET, putting away laundry, etc) took each time to make planning easier over time.
