# Assignment 1

**Potential problem areas:**

1. Time Management: organizing tasks to make tackling the day easier.

2. Casual sports watching: emphasize the fun, social, casual side of being a sports fan or viewer and remove the focus from knowing everything or winning a bet or fantasy game.

3. Reality TV viewing: foster community among viewers of different shows, even who are not watching on the day of release.

4. Weightlifting: simplify tracking and progressing lifts with more neutral language than most current platforms feature.

5. Trivia: be able to socially share fun facts and special interests.

6. New music: make finding new music, especially beyond what you currently listen to, easier and more social.

7. Budgeting: provide financial information and budgeting resources for college students whose lives vary from season-to-season.

8. Long-distance bonding: games, conversation starters, or activities to be done between long-distance friends, families, or couples to keep things fun!

9. Research: help organize ideas, lines of reasoning, or questions during research deep dives.

10. Travel: exploring new cities or new parts of your own city through curated suggestions

**Let's dive a bit deeper:**

*Domain #1:* Time Management

I've selected this as one of my domains of interest because I feel as though it is the most relevant to me currently as a college student. Especially at MIT, there are so many tasks to keep track of, and while there are a lot of existing systems available, it seems like there are certain gaps in what is currently out there, especially given the unique features of a college student's schedule.

Potential Problems:

    1. Creating complex to-do lists. -> I often run into the situation where I have a bunch of tasks to tackle, but some of them need to happen in certain orders. It would be helpful to have an easy interface to keep track of these dependencies and create viable to-do lists. 

    2. Time blocking. -> Though many people benefit from time blocking to plan their day or week in advance, it can be difficult when you don't know how long certain tasks will take, even when you've done them many times before. 

    3. Planning with conditional tasks. -> I often find myself in the position where, depending on some other event, a given task can happen at one of a few possible times. It would be nice to keep track of these variable plans and share them with your friends.

*Domain #4:* Weightlifting

I've chosen this as a domain for further consideration because weightlifting is a valuable and important hobby in my life, but I have struggled to find resources suited for my needs. There is an emphasis placed on those who bodybuild or powerlift competitively, and these rhetorics are not always well fit for those who engage in these activities for leisure.

Potential Problems:

    1. Tracking personalized progressive overload. -> In weightlifting, it is important to continue making progress, but there is not a one-size-fits-all form that this progress takes. Depending on a person's goals, their path can vary drastically, and it can be difficult to accomodate these differences.
    
    2. Planning meal prep and groceries. -> This would seek to simplify the decision making processes for planning macro-friendly meals, as well as the corresponding grocery list creation.

    3. Reactive workout scheduler. -> When having a bad workout, it can be best to adjust your existing plan to avoid injury or burnout. It would help to be able to easily modify the plan as written when early movements are not going to plan.


*Domain #6:* New Music

I've chosen this as my final domain of interest because I feel as though, while the market is well saturated with apps for sharing and discovering music, there are certain specific features I would like to see more readily available. Music is such a valuable tool for connection and making that easier can only be for the better.

Potential Problems:

    1. Beating the algorithms. -> Given the algorithms that exist on music streaming services, it can be difficult to try to find new music far beyond your usual listening habits. It can be valuable to connect with people who have very different listen habits from yourself to be introduced to new songs you wouldn't otherwise be presented with.

    2. Crowd sourcing new music. -> Sometimes, you want a song, album, or artist with a very specific vibe that Spotify or Apple Music would not be helpful in interpretting. Having a digital soapbox to call out requests and let people submit their suggestions or endorse those of other people could help connect people with songs they're looking for.

    3. Expanding your bubble. -> In a given area, it would be fun to learn what types of music the people around you are listening to if they are interested in sharing. 


**Problems to consider**
For further exploration, I will select problems 1, 2, and 7. For those I haven't selected, please see the brief explanation as to why below.

1. Creating complex to-do lists. ☑
    - Why? I feel as though this is a problem many people face often that is being consistently reconsidered and reworked. It feels like a manageable scale that could be well-executed given the tools available and time allotted and could have drastically positive impact on those who do use it. 

2. Time blocking. ☑
    - Why? Similarly to problem 1, I feel as though this is a manageably sized problem while still packing potential impact given how ubiquitous of a problem it is. For tasks that are tackled consistently, it can be incredibly valuable to gain these insights, and this value does not rely on high levels of adoption or complex physical solutions. A simple but thoughtful design could be monumentally beneficial.

3. Planning with conditional tasks. 
    - Why not? While this is a commonly occurring problem within my own life, from my brief exploration, it did not seem like a naturally occurring need for many people. My alternative focuses within this domain seem to better cover the more common problems people face within the space of time management.

4. Tracking personalized progressive overload. 
    - Why not? I'm drawn to this as an idea for myself, but without specific exercise science background, I do not feel confident in my ability to implement this at a larger scale safely.
    
5. Planning meal prep and groceries. 
    - Why not? This is in line with personal projects I have previously implemented, and while I could explore further, there are already many similar services on the market and I would prefer to explore other avenues. 

6. Reactive workout scheduler. 
    - Why not? Similarly to problem 4, I am very drawn to this idea, but do not feel confident in my personal ability to implement it safely without specific education in the field.

7. Beating the algorithms. ☑
    - Why? As someone who listens to a lot of very similar music, I feel as though this is a problem I'm very familiar with and have imagined possible solutions to many times. I think it is a common experience, and many people love music and like using it as a tool to connect with other people. I recognize the need for some significant amount of adoption for meaningful impact, but I think it is at least worth further consideration at this point.

8. Crowdsourcing new music. 
    - Why not? I like this idea, but I think existing platforms (i.e. Reddit, X, etc) have existing domains where these conversations happen naturally, and I don't think it would be inherently improved by having its own dedicated space. However, it could interplay with problem 7 within the same plaltform.

9. Expanding your bubble. 
    - Why not? This would only be engaging with pretty high levels of adoption, so I don't think it is a route worth heavily pursuing for this type of project. 

**Exploring Selected Problems**

*Problem #1:* Creating complex to-do lists.

Stakeholders:

1. College students: As a college student myself, this perspective is the one that comes easiest to mind. Students lives are quite variables and lack a long-term structure in a way that suits this kind of flexible time management tool.

2. Working professionals: Though different from my own perspective, I can imagine that there are many tasks within a corporate job that require interdependency. For professionals, however, I think there is more interpersonal dependency that would require additional complexity to properly accomodate.

3. Parents: While there are still plenty of interdependent tasks for parents, I imagine this platform being less suited for them as it is much harder to structure a day in advance when caring for children, which is inherently unpredictable. 

Features:

1. Dependence of tasks. -> When entering in tasks for the day, be able to acknowledge that they must happen before or after certain other tasks. 

2. Relative timing of tasks. -> When planning for the day, users could enter that certain tasks have deadlines earlier than other tasks, to make sure they are prioritized in the list overall. 

3. Controlled randomization of to-do list. -> Given the provided information, generate a viable to-do list in a random order that maintains the necessary constraints. This could also include the option to reveal each task one at a time, only revealing once the previous was marked as "complete". 

Evidence:
1. [Using randomness](https://medium.com/@haimson/using-randomness-to-improve-work-productivity-4c835d645204) can help foster productivity.

2. There are many [basic to-do list apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-todo-list-apps/), but none seem to lean into the idea of controlled randomness.

3. To-do lists are a [valuable, reliable tool](https://hbr.org/2022/01/why-we-continue-to-rely-on-and-love-to-do-lists) for many people, but have [flaws](https://hbr.org/2012/01/to-do-lists-dont-work) that prevent some people from reaping their benefits.

4. Still, some experts say that [to-do lists are a flawed approach altogether](https://www.fastcompany.com/90890188/your-to-do-list-is-sabotaging-your-true-productivity-heres-what-to-do-instead), so this angle may not be the correct solution to the problem at hand.

5. Regardless, there are many ways that a [to-do list can be optimized](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/how-to-create-a-to-do-list-that-makes-you-smile.html#good-to-do-list). Additional considerations include in-depth descriptions and suitable flexiblity.

6. In recent years, more attention has been brought to [randomizing your to-do list](https://chelsijo.co/2023/04/03/episode-297-tackle-random-to-dos/) to make it more manageable.

7. In (somewhat outdated) [searches for similar platforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/bkpwky/to_do_list_app_with_task_dependencies/), there were limited options and both have design components that could be improved upon.


*Problem #2:* Time blocking.

Stakeholders:

1. Students: In a given semester, students often encounter the same types of tasks often, but it can be hard to predict how long a given iteration will take. Still, it can be especially valuable to block off time for the many courses, campus involvements, and personal activities a student is a part of, so tackling this problem feels especially relevant to students.

2. Entreprenuers: Without a formal corporate structure, those that are self-employed or working at startups could benefit from accurate time blocking to be sure they are getting tasks done efficiently and time is being allocated appropriately.

3. Business leaders: Understanding the schedule of your team can be imperative to accurately setting and reaching deadlines. Having a shared tool for this kind of record keeping could make this much easier with minimal individual overhead. This would require the ability to have teams of users tackling shared or common tasks. 

Features:

1. Task time keeping. -> For repeated tasks, catalog how long each iteration takes to make more useful predictions in future planning. 

2. Time blocking. -> Provide a digital planner to slot in necessary tasks, accounting for information regarding how long certain tasks typically take to minimize wasted time. 

3. Teams. -> For work or project settings, allow groups to collaboratively record and plan using shared tasks to accurately record keep the distribution of labor, time spent on certain stages, and proximity to completion.

Evidence:
1. People have a very difficult time accurately [predicting or recalling how long tasks take](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-bad-is-our-perception_b_3955696).

2. [Effective time management](https://lpsonline.sas.upenn.edu/features/mastering-your-schedule-effective-time-management-strategies-success) has massive effects on productivity, focus, work quality, and personal quality of life.

3. [Time blocking](https://hbr.org/2018/12/how-timeboxing-works-and-why-it-will-make-you-more-productive) in particular has, at least for some people, even more promising benefits.

4. [Existing apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-time-blocking-app/) rely on existing knowledge of how long certain tasks take, arguably the most daunting part of the whole process.

5. The efficacy of time blocking and other time management approaches relies on accurate [time estimation](https://myhours.com/articles/estimating-time).

6. In group settings, recording [collective time](https://hbr.org/2014/06/manage-your-teams-collective-time) can help with team productivity and overall management.

7. Especially in [professional settings](https://myhours.com/articles/improve-project-management-with-time-tracking), this information can also be useful at a much higher level to understand business operations.

*Problem #7:* Beating the algorithms.

Stakeholders:

1. Music listeners: The most obvious stakeholder is those who would most be inclined to use such a platform to discover new songs. This covers most music listeners, but particularly those who listen to a lot of similar music and wish to explore new genres or those who really like sharing their own music taste. 

2. Musicians: Musicians who would like their music to be seen by more people, especially those who are underutilized by existing music platform algorithms, would be affected by specific design choices made in the implementation of such an idea. 

3. Music platforms: Unfortantely, by the nature of diverging from the existing music promotion algorithms, existing platforms would likely be unhappy with such a platform existing and motivating its users to source their music suggestions elsewhere. This is a useful consideration in further investigation.

Features:

1. Music pen pals. -> Users could highlight their listening habits on their profile and seek out others whose listening piques their interest. They could become "pen pals" and share songs or albums with one another to help curate new portions of their music taste. 

2. Crowdsourcing. -> When searching for music with a certain "vibe" that perhaps cannot be easily understood by a search algorithm, people could make public requests and others could share their suggestions or endorse the suggestions of others.

3. Music showcases. -> Music fans could capture certain portions of their taste in formats beyond traditional playlists. This could include highlighting interesting statistics like they do for the end-of-year wrapups for Spotify and Apple Music or other points of interest, serving more like a vision board than a standard playlist or account.

Evidence:
1. There are many [music platforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/MusicRecommendations/comments/1khmo0n/best_music_platform/) and many [supplementary apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/o7ff3y/need_for_a_social_music_app/) for sharing music. However, these seem to emphasize sharing with your existing friends, rather than expanding more broadly.

2. Music is a [fundamental part](https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2015/everyone-listens-to-music-but-how-we-listen-is-changing/) of almost everyone's lives and brings many people a lot of [joy](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/music-and-health).

3. More than just being fun, [discovering new music](https://www.insidehook.com/wellness/mental-health-benefits-new-music) can have meaningful mental health benefits like mitigating depression and anxiety.

4. Music can be a [powerful tool in connecting people](https://medium.com/illumination/the-power-of-playlists-1bf4318ab5ed), even those without existing connections.

5. [Expanding your music taste](https://www.thefamuanonline.com/2021/10/25/expand-your-music-taste/) can help in creative expression, as well as contributing to additional beneficial factors mentioned above.

6.
