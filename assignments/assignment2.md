# Assignment 2

## Problem statement.
**Problem domain:** Time Management 

Time management is of the utmost importance for people across all fields, focuses, and backgrounds. Whether professional, academic, or personal, to-dos seem to pile up, and it becomes increasingly valuable to have a way to tackle them. As a college student, it often feels like there is such a wide array of tasks to tackle, and it becomes incredibly daunting to try and piece together a logical plan for accomplishing them. However, good time management is not just a resume skill; it can grant you freedom to relax, socialize, and engage with hobbies. By staying on top of your to-dos, you can ultimately achieve a more balanced life. 

**Problem:** Interdependent To-Do Lists

Time management is, of course, a broad domain, and there are many different angles to take. Personally, one of the pressing issues I experience is the case of interdependent tasks complicating the creation of a to-do list. In my academics, this can look like needing to complete a reading before I can write a discussion post. In my personal life, I need to go grocery shopping before I can make my meal prep for the week. While each of these interdependencies may seem quite simple on its face, the web of connections can quickly become daunting, especially when I need to do the reading, discussion post, shopping, and cooking all in the same weekend. Often, it would be helpful to randomize the tasks at hand to avoid decision fatigue, but this is not made easy when tasks depend on one another. So, an app to digest these dependencies and produce a viable to-do lists would help address this problem.

**Stakeholders:**

1. College students: With a wide range of types of tasks to tackle, college students often encounter this problem. As young adults, they are also particularly benefited by tools to help develop these time management skills.

2. Working professionals: In a professional setting, different projects and tasks can have large numbers of interdependencies that make them likely to encounter this problem. 

3. Parents: When accounting for your own life and the life of others within your home, it can be incredibly difficult to account for all the different variables and the ways in which they interplay with one another. 

**Evidence & Comparables:** 
*Evidence:*
- [Benefits of To-Do Lists](https://hbr.org/2022/01/why-we-continue-to-rely-on-and-love-to-do-lists) - To-do lists can be a powerful tool for many people in managing their lives, so improving this tool to better reflect life would be to the benefit of at least some stakeholders.
- [Benefits of Randomness](https://medium.com/@haimson/using-randomness-to-improve-work-productivity-4c835d645204) - Randomness can help foster productivity.
- [To-Do List Flexibility](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/how-to-create-a-to-do-list-that-makes-you-smile.html#good-to-do-list) - While to-do lists are not a "one-size-fits-all" tool for time management, allowing for flexibility can benefit users.

*Comparables:*
- [General To-Do List Apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-todo-list-apps/) - There are many strong to-do list platforms. In general, each focus on some specific aspect of time management like tackling procrastintion, time blocking, or preventing burnout. However, none seem to utilize the idea of dependency-minded randomness, meaning there is room in the market for this idea.
- [Apps with Interdependencies](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/bkpwky/to_do_list_app_with_task_dependencies/) - When looking for tools that consider task interdependencies, there are few solid comparable options, each with notable design limitations of there own. However, the fact that there are users requesting such features reaffirms the demand for such a platform.


## Application pitch. 
**Task Tackler**

Often, as your list of to-dos grows, various tasks will depend on one another -- you probably shouldn't take out the trash until you've cleaned your room and you definitely can't clean the bathroom until you've gone to the store to buy more disinfecting wipes. However, it can be daunting to create a to-do list that captures all these relationships. That's where Task Tackler comes in. Task Tackler has a few key features that help tackle this commonly-encountered problem:

1. *Task Dependency* - While entering to-dos into the app, a user can denote its relationship to another task. These dependencies include "must happen before", "must happen after", "must happen immediately before", and "must happen immediately after". These relationships will be enforced across all task orderings, both those entered manually and those generated by the platform. This is the key feature to address the identified problem through consideration of dependencies in tasks.

2. *Order Generation* - Users can create multiple lists, containing various tasks from their task bank. In creating the list, users can drag-and-drop tasks to create a default ordering, and the system will help to enforce the dependencies between tasks. When activating a list, users can use this ordering or have the app create a random ordering that also respects these dependencies. 

3. *Productivity Sessions* - To inspire focus when tackling their to-do lists, users will start a session associated with a list. Before activating a session, the user can select whether to use the set order from the list or have a randomly selected order as described above. They can also select how they would like to be presented the tasks, either in a list format or one at a time. Having made these selections, the user can activate the session and will be presented their tasks as requested. While in session, the app will be designed to inspire focus and motivation for the tasks at hand.

## Concept design. 
Design a set of concepts that will embody the functionality of your app and deliver its features. We expect you to have 3-5 concepts. Fewer than 3 concepts would probably mean limited functionality or a lack of separation of concerns; more than 5 likely suggests overambition or lack of focus. (Talk to us if you think you need more!) The deliverables are:

- The concept specifications, written in the standard form.

- Some essential synchronizations. You do not need an exhaustive collection of synchronizations, but should capture (a) any essential design ideas that involve multiple concepts; (b) representative syncs for kinds of sync that are common throughout your application (such as syncs for access control or notification).

- A brief note, at most half a page long, explaining the role that your concepts play in the context of the app as a whole. For example, if you have an authentication or authorization concept, you should say how it’s used to control access to other particular concepts. You should also explain how generic type parameters will be instantiated whenever it’s non obvious. (For example, that a generic user type will be bound to the users of an authentication concept is obvious; that the targeted items of an upvoting concept are users would not be.)

**Concepts**
```
concept TaskBank[Relation]
purpose allow for tasks to relate to one another
principle users can enter tasks and denote their relationship to other existing tasks.
state
    a set of Tasks with 
        a taskName String

```
```

        requires : no List with listName exists in set of Lists
        effect : new List with title = listName, itemCount = 0, and an empty set of ListItems is returned and added to set of Lists
    addTask (list : List, task : Task) : ListItem
        requires : listItem containing task is not already in list
        effect : a new listItem is created with task = task, taskStatus = incomplete, and defaultOrder = itemCount+1. itemCount is incremented. the new listItem is returned and added to list's set of listItems.
    deleteTask (list : List, task : Task)
        requires : a listIem containing task is in list's set of listItems
        effect : the listItem containing task is removed from list's set of listItems
    assignOrder (list : List, task : Task, newOrder : Number)
        requires : task belongs to a ListItem in list
        effects : task's ListItem gets defaultOrder set to newOrder and the ListItems with defaultOrders between the old value and new value are offset by one accordingly
```
```
concept Session[List, TaskStatus, OrderType, FormatType]
purpose a focused session of completing all tasks on a list
principle a user will "activate" a list to start a session and be given an ordered list (either default ordering or generated) of tasks on the list to complete
state
    a Session with
        a List with
            a title String
            a set of ListItems with
                a task Task
                an defaultOrder Number
                a randomOrder Number
                an itemStatus TaskStatus
            an itemCount Number
        an active Flag
        an ordering OrderType
        a format FormatType
actions
    changeSession (list : List)
        requires : there is not an active session
        effects : makes list the Session's List with each randomOrder = defaultOrder, itemStatus = Incomplete, active = False, ordering = Default, and format = List
    setOrdering (newType : OrderType)
        requires : session's active Flag is currently False
        effects : ordering is set to newType
    setFormat (newFormat : FormatType)
        requires : session's active Flag is currently False
        effects: format is set to newFormat
    randomizeOrder ()
        requires : session's ordering is set to "Random"
        effects : each ListItems randomOrder value is updated at random, maintaining dependencies between tasks
    activateSession ( )
        requires : session's active Flag is currently False
        effects : session's active Flag is set to True
    startTask (task : Task)
        requires : task is in a ListItem for session's list, its status is currently "Incomplete", and no other task is "In Progress"
        effects: given ListItem's status is set to "In Progress"
    completeTask (task : Task)
        requires : task is in a ListItem for session's list and its status is currently "In Progress"
        effects : given ListItem's status is set to "Complete"
    endSession ( )
        requires : session's active Flag is currently True
        effects : session's active Flag is set to False
```

**Syncs**
sync addToList
when 
    ListCreation.addTask(list, task)
then 
    TaskBank.getDependencies(task)

sync maintainDependencies
when 
    ListCreation.assignOrder(list, task)
then 
    TaskBank.getDependencies(task)
    for each Dependency:
        TaskBank.evaluateOrder(task, depTask)

sync preventInvalidRandomization
when 
    Session.randomizeOrder()
then 
    enforce TaskBank.getDependencies(task) for each task

**A Brief Note**
With the key concepts and syncs established, I hope it is clear the role each plays in the user experience of the app. The TaskBank serves as a homepage for users to cache all their typical to-dos and their dependencies. Users can create multiple lists of to-dos, serving as subsets of the task bank. Finally, users can activate a session, a focused period of time to tackle a specific list of to-dos. Here is where the dependencies are most relevant, and users can have the session randomly generate an order for the tasks while maintaining the dependencies between tasks. 

While there is some flexibility when looking forward to implementation, I was considering the following generic type construction throughout concept design:
```
Relation := ["Must happen before", "Must happen after", "Must happen right before", "Must happen right after"]
TaskStatus := ["Incomplete", "In Progress", "Complete"]
OrderType := ["Default", "Random"]
FormatType := ["List", "Reveal"]
```

## UI Sketches. 
Here are some high-level sketches of the UI I am picturing for Task Tackler.

![wireframes](assets/wireframes.jpg)


## User journey. 
Jane has a lot on her plate: academics, clubs, job applications, and typical life maintenance. She tries and fails to make to-do lists or calendars that help manage her busy life. Finally, she turns to Task Tackler. She starts by brain dumping all of the things she has to do in that moment: do a reading, write a discussion post, finish a pset, respond to emails, do her laundry, go to the store. As she enters each into the Task Bank, she notes that she needs to do the reading before she can write the discussion post and she needs to go to the store before she can do her laundry. Then, she creates a new list and adds all the tasks she needs to complete that day, deciding she can wait to respond to the email and do her laundry until the next day. Once she has created her list, she activates the session. Today, she decides to use the randomized ordering and the reveal format. Once she presses start, her first task is given: "Do reading". So, she does her reading. When she's done, she comes back and marks it as complete. Then, she is presented with her next task. This continues until she has completed all her tasks for the day. She finally feels like she can keep track of all of the things on her plate without making time management a whole new task of its own.
