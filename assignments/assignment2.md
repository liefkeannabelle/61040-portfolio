# Assignment 2

## Problem statement.
**Problem domain:** Time Management 

Time management is of the utmost importance for people across all fields, focuses, and backgrounds. Whether professional, academic, or personal, to-dos seem to pile up, and it becomes increasingly valuable to have a way to tackle them. As a college student, it often feels like there is such a wide array of tasks to tackle, and it becomes incredibly daunting to try and piece together a logical plan for accomplishing them. However, good time management is not just a resume skill; it can grant you freedom to relax, socialize, and engage with hobbies. By staying on top of your to-dos, you can ultimately achieve a more balanced life. 

**Problem:** Interdependent To-Do Lists

Time management is, of course, a broad domain, and there are many different angles to take. Personally, one of the pressing issues I experience is the case of interdependent tasks complicating the creation of a to-do list. In my academics, this can look like needing to complete a reading before I can write a discussion post. In my personal life, I need to go grocery shopping before I can make my meal prep for the week. While each of these interdependencies may seem quite simple on its face, the web of connections can quickly become daunting, especially when I need to do the reading, discussion post, shopping, and cooking all in the same weekend. Often, it would be helpful to randomize the tasks at hand to avoid decision fatigue, but this is not made easy when tasks depend on one another. So, an app to digest these dependencies and produce a viable to-do lists would help address this problem.

**Stakeholders:**

1. College students: With a wide range of types of tasks to tackle, college students often encounter this problem. As young adults, they are also particularly benefited by tools to help develop these time management skills.

2. Working professionals: In a professional setting, different projects and tasks can have large numbers of interdependencies that make them likely to encounter this problem. 

3. Parents: When accounting for your own life and the life of others within your home, it can be incredibly difficult to account for all the different variables and the ways in which they interplay with one another. 

**Evidence & Comparables:** 
*Evidence:*
- [Benefits of To-Do Lists](https://hbr.org/2022/01/why-we-continue-to-rely-on-and-love-to-do-lists) - To-do lists can be a powerful tool for many people in managing their lives, so improving this tool to better reflect life would be to the benefit of at least some stakeholders.
- [Benefits of Randomness](https://medium.com/@haimson/using-randomness-to-improve-work-productivity-4c835d645204) - Randomness can help foster productivity.
- [To-Do List Flexibility](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/how-to-create-a-to-do-list-that-makes-you-smile.html#good-to-do-list) - While to-do lists are not a "one-size-fits-all" tool for time management, allowing for flexibility can benefit users.

*Comparables:*
- [General To-Do List Apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-todo-list-apps/) - There are many strong to-do list platforms. In general, each focus on some specific aspect of time management like tackling procrastintion, time blocking, or preventing burnout. However, none seem to utilize the idea of dependency-minded randomness, meaning there is room in the market for this idea.
- [Apps with Interdependencies](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/bkpwky/to_do_list_app_with_task_dependencies/) - When looking for tools that consider task interdependencies, there are few solid comparable options, each with notable design limitations of there own. However, the fact that there are users requesting such features reaffirms the demand for such a platform.


## Application pitch. 
Construct a succinct but compelling pitch that explains, in terms understandable to a lay user, how your application will solve the problem. Your pitch should be around half a page in length, and should include the following deliverables:

- A name: pick a fun and memorable name for your application.

- A motivation: summarize the problem that your application will solve in a sentence.

- Key features: explain up to three features in a brief narrative, ensuring that each has a name and a simple explanation of what the feature is; why it helps mitigate the problem; and how it impacts stakeholders. (See the note in the advice section on concepts vs. features.)


## Concept design. 
Design a set of concepts that will embody the functionality of your app and deliver its features. We expect you to have 3-5 concepts. Fewer than 3 concepts would probably mean limited functionality or a lack of separation of concerns; more than 5 likely suggests overambition or lack of focus. (Talk to us if you think you need more!) The deliverables are:

- The concept specifications, written in the standard form.

- Some essential synchronizations. You do not need an exhaustive collection of synchronizations, but should capture (a) any essential design ideas that involve multiple concepts; (b) representative syncs for kinds of sync that are common throughout your application (such as syncs for access control or notification).

- A brief note, at most half a page long, explaining the role that your concepts play in the context of the app as a whole. For example, if you have an authentication or authorization concept, you should say how it’s used to control access to other particular concepts. You should also explain how generic type parameters will be instantiated whenever it’s non obvious. (For example, that a generic user type will be bound to the users of an authentication concept is obvious; that the targeted items of an upvoting concept are users would not be.)


## UI Sketches. 
Construct some low-fidelity sketches of your user interface that show the primary user interface elements and their rough layout, annotated with pointers or comments to explain anything that might not be obvious. You should omit any error handling and standard interactions (such as user registration), but should aim to convey how the essential features appear and are used. You can use any tool you like to draw the sketches, or you can draw them by hand and scan them. You should include them in your design document as images referenced in markdown.


## User journey. 
Write a narrative that follows a single stakeholder as they encounter the problem and use your designed app to address it. Tell their story in chronological order: what triggers their need, the steps they take with the app (referring to the wireframes), and the outcome. A good journey should both persuade a reader that the problem is worth solving, and illustrate how your app might help solve it. The deliverable here is a few short paragraphs that form a coherent story but identify individual steps clearly, and that reference your sketches when appropriate.
